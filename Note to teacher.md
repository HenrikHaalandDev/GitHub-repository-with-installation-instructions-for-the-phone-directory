# Notes to Teachers

## Overview
I wanted to share some thoughts about my learning during this task.


## Kanban
- I used it much more than I thought I would. 
- Quite useful, and I can see how useful it can be in a teamwork based task

## Learning Sources
- Most of what I've learned about making the README look nice came from ChatGPT. 
- I do understand how everything works

## Working with Partner
- I haven’t been able to work with my learning partner since I’ve been sick a lot. I hope I can catch up with some group tasks later.

## Conclusion
- Overall, this was a good task, but it felt like too much to do in less than a week.
- Trying to fit everything we've learned from the start of the year into this has been tough.
